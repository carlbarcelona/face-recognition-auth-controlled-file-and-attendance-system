# Will serve as the security gate in order for the user to access the file they created
# The user is first noticed about the 4 main functionalities of the program: upload image, attendance logging, txt file creation, and txt viewing
# Added: The program have the capability to convert an image to RGB format
# The program then logs the name and time, the user appeared in the program
# The csv file generated here will be used in order for the user to access the main body of information they inputted
# The program accounted for errors that may arise during the program execution
# Important: Previous projects such as file edit and view are incorporated in this program
# Added: a functionality to let the user upload his/her own picture using Tkinter
# Added: security features such as passcode, face recognition, and record matching were utilized to protect user info
# Added: a functionality that let's the user create a txt file and input information there
# Added: a functionality to view the txt file created by other users
